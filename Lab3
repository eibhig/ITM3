Q3
Discussion: the object for the project charter is to submit it to a financial department, never considered that. 
Should they be considered a shareholder?
i also should considered the career councellor.
I look at this in the current cliamte with all the Computer Sciences having been moved to Online. 
Alex created a Project Charter that has a better overall application. 

alex had been very kind on his review of my project charter. Mine was not as wordly as his. He gave my work a 4.5/5
realistically it should be around 3.(or less)
